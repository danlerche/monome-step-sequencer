# monome-step-sequencer
This is a step sequencer written for the monome 64, http://monome.org/ and arduinomes and designed for use Max For Live.The bottom row shows the timeline, and includes a reset, backwards, random play options, as well as the ability to store (hold for three seconds) and recall presets.   The remaining 7 buttons in each column are notes. By default they are chromatic, but one can also change the octaves, note ranges, and scales.  Designed to work for both drum samplers and synths within Ableton. Note duration may also be tweaked.  See the chart inside the device for me. Happy noise making!

Add this to your preset folder in Ableton Live, or open in Max 7, as you can now open all max for live devices there. 
Instructions:

Drag the two files to your Ableton Live folder/User Library/Presets/Midi Effects/Max Midi Effects

Known Issues:

Saving presets sometimes causes three lights to blink over and over. Once this bug is fixed I'll call it 1.0.
